## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This project will investigate the tourism industry of Europe. This is an industry of considerable size and impact on the population as European countries alone saw 50 % (745 million of the 1.5 billion global total) of the international tourist arrivals in 2019. Furthermore, in 2018, the tourism industry directly and indirectly contributed 10.3 % of GDP and 11.7% of total employment (27.3 million workers) in the European Union (EU). [1]  One of the tools tourists often use to guide themselves in foreign landscapes is the internet, specifically travel reviews on attractions and accommodations. Reviews and ratings on attractions lets tourists know what to expect from that service, experience, or accommodation. Additionally, it enables business owners review the quality of their services and their competitors. Thus, this project will look at the average Google reviews of many different tourist attractions across Europe. By looking at the average rating given by users to different categories of services, experiences, and accommodations, different trends and information can be elucidated about the consensus tourist experience for these different types of attractions. This is valuable information for both tourists and business owners as it provides a reference for the average given experience for different attractions. This can guide informed decisions in tourists and help business owners improve their services to increase profits. Finally, this can also be useful information for government and policy makers to make knowledgeable choices around the tourism industry.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset represents the average Google review rating on a scale from 1-5 for 24 different travel attractions: churches, resorts, beaches, parks, theatres, museums, malls, zoos, restaurants, pubs/bars, local services, burger/pizza shops, hotels/other lodgings, juice bars, art galleries, dance clubs, swimming pools, gyms, bakeries, beauty & spas, cafes, viewpoints, monuments, and gardens. The dataset contains this information from 5656 different users, contains no missing values, and has 0 representing 4.1% of the total values. The data does not contain a location variable, but represents the average google rating, by user, for the different travel attraction categories across Europe. Thus, it is key to note that the total number of observations for each category, per user, is not specified, nor is the specific location/business/attraction of the average value provided in the dataset. This dataset may be understood as an overall consensus of the average experience and quality of different tourist attractions across Europe. Raw data file was acquired from the UCI Machine Learning Repository entitled ‘Travel Review Ratings Data Set’ and data can be referenced to Renjith et al. 2018. [2,3] The pathway to the raw data file from the main directory in this repository is as follows: /data/raw/google_review_ratings.csv
